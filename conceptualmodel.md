**SIF AU Conceptual Data Model, NSIP**

v.0.3, 2018-04-09

[linda.marshall@nsip.edu.au](mailto:linda.marshall@nsip.edu.au) [nick.nicholas@nsip.edu.au](mailto:nick.nicholas@nsip.edu.au)

This document proposes a conceptual model underlying the SIF-AU 3.4.3 data model. The conceptual model is at the level of entities and relations between them; attributes are not listed. All objects in the Australian data model are represented; some objects are represented as relations between entities, rather than as distinct entities.

For clarity, the conceptual model is broken up into use cases:

- [Enrolment](#enrolment)
- [Provisioning](#provisioning)
- [Timetable/Attendance](#timetableattendance)
- [Finance/Resources](#financeresources)
- [NAPLAN](#naplan)
- [Wellbeing](#wellbeing)
- [Classroom Assessment](#classroomassessment)
- [Scheduling](#scheduling)
- [Statistics](#statistics)
- [Teaching & Learning](#teachinglearning)

Entities are named with names that the schools sector business can relate to readily, rather than the current names of SIF-AU objects. A list mapping the conceptual model names to SIF objects follows.


<a name="enrolment"></a>
# Enrolment

The following are the primary objects involved in enrolling a student onto school systems.

The following includes secondary objects which may also be invoked during student enrolment (shaded grey).

### Enrolment - entities

Relations which map to SIF objects are given in lowercase and italicised.

<a name="provisioning"></a>
# Provisioning

The grey arrows point to superclasses; e.g. Party is a superclass of Teacher, Parent, and Student. The dotted entity Party is not represented separately in the SIF-AU data model; a common type contains Personal information.

<a name="timetableattendance"></a>
# Timetable/Attendance

  ![](TimetableAttendance.png)
  
  
<a name="financeresources"></a>
# Finance/Resources

The grey arrows point to superclasses; e.g. Debtor is a superclass of Vendor. The dotted entities, Invoicee and Transaction, are not represented separately in the SIF-AU data model; they are realised through a choice of links to their subclass objects.

  ![](FinanceResources.png)

<a name="naplan"></a>
# NAPLAN

  ![](NAPLAN.png)

<a name="wellbeing"></a>
# Wellbeing

The entities in the Wellbeing Usecase are densely interrelated; an Individualised Plan, for example, can draw on all of Behaviour Events, Alerts, and Wellbeing Characteristics. The relations indicated here are not an exhaustive list, and some relations have been left out for clarity.

<a name="classroomassessment"></a>
# Classroom Assessment

  ![](Gradebook.png)

<a name="scheduling"></a>
# Scheduling

The grey arrows point to superclasses; e.g. Resource is a superclass of Room and Learning Resource. The dotted entity Resource is not represented separately in the SIF-AU data model; it is realised through a choice of links to their subclass objects.

<a name="statistics"></a>
# Statistics

The greyed out objects are of secondary importance to the specification, and have been little used to date.

# Teaching & Learning

The greyed out objects are of secondary importance to the specification, and have been little used to date.
