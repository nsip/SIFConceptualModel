SIF AU Conceptual Model

This document contains a representation of the conceptual model for the [SIF AU specification](http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/AU). It has been updated to version 3.4.3, and will keep being updated with new releases of the SIF AU data model.

The conceptual model is restricted in scope, compared to other models such as NEDM (National Education Data Model, expressed in OWL; no longer online). It includes entities that are objects in the SIF AU data model and the relations between them, with only occasional use of superclasses. The conceptual model is derived from the SIF AU physical model (the relations correspond to RefID links in the objects), but allows the SIF data model to be navigated at a more abstract level.
